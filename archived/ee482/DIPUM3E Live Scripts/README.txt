The accompanying files are MATLAB Live Scripts containing some of the examples from the book Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB, 3rd edition, by Rafael C. Gonzalez, Richard E. Woods, and Steven L. Eddins, Gatesmark Press, 2020.

The files can be opened in the MATLAB Editor, where you will be able to read the example text and equations, see the MATLAB code, and see the MATLAB output and generated figures. You can also execute the code in MATLAB, or explore variations by modifying the code yourself and then executing it. For more information about Live Scripts in MATLAB, see:

Most of the examples use sample images or data that are provided with the book. You can obtain these images and data by getting the DIPUM3E Support Package, which is available here:
