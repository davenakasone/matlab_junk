% ch2sp2     In this example, we find Laplace transforms of time functions using 
% the command, laplace(f), where f is a time function, f(t). As an example, we use 
% the time functions that resulted from the calculations in Cases 2 and 3 in 
% Section 2.2 in the text and work in reverse to obtain their Laplace transforms. 
% We will see that the command, laplace(f), yields F(s) in partial fractions. In 
% addition to pretty printing discussed in the previous example, the Symbolic Math 
% Toolbox contains other commands that can change the look of the displayed result 
% for readability and form. Some of these commands are: collect(F) - collect common 
% coefficient terms of F; expand(F) - expands product of factors of F; 
% factor(F) - factors F; simple(F) - finds simplest form of F with the least 
% number of terms; simplify(F) - simplifies F; vpa(expression,places) - standing 
% for variable precision arithmetic, this  command converts fractional symbolic 
% terms into decimal terms with a specified number of decimal places. For 
% example, the symbolic fraction, 3/16, would be converted to 0.1875 if the 
% argument, places, were 4. In the example below, we find the Laplace 
% transform of a time function. The result is displayed as partial fractions. 
% To combine the partial fractions, we use the command, simplify(F), where F 
% is the Laplace transform of f(t) found using laplace(f). Finally, we use 
% F=vpa(F,3) to convert the symbolic fractions to decimals in the displayed  
% result.
